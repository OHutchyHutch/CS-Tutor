# CS-Tutor
A Java textbook/reference aid made by a computer science student at Georgia State University.

This whole project will display what I have come to learn and understand about java and java concepts throughout my college
career. At the time of writing this readme (April 24th, 2019) I am on my final days of my second semester.


## What exactly is CS-Tutor?
Computer Science Tutor, or CS-Tutor is a project created by a Georgia State Computer Science student that catalogs most of
what they are learning and puts it into a format similiar to a textbook or reference aid. CS-Tutor is made primarily for
developers that already know java but need help refreshing their mind from time to time. That being said, CS-Tutor is also
made to be easy to understand for newcomers to java development. If you are a newcomer to Java, please note that the topics
covered in this project are in no means a proper order to learn java development. You can expect that it will be within a
reasonable order (as I will add more as I learn in later months and years, which will get added to the end of the list).


## Update Description:
- Fix: Often just bug/format fixing. Optimizations can be including in here.
- Optims: An update devoted to some optimization of resources.
- Addon: An updated that adds more information.
- UI: A visual fix.
- Rework: The biggest update of all. I've learned something major to improve or change so I did it.


Thank you so much for checking out CS-Tutor, I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me!
